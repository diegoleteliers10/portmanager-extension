# Port Manager

A powerful Raycast extension for monitoring and managing open ports on your Windows system. Quickly view all active TCP ports, identify which processes are using them, and terminate processes with a single action.

## Features

- **Port Monitoring**: View all open TCP ports on your system in real-time
- **Process Identification**: See which processes are using specific ports with process names and PIDs
- **Quick Process Termination**: Kill processes using specific ports with a single action
- **Search & Filter**: Search through ports by address, PID, or process name
- **Copy Actions**: Copy port addresses, PIDs, or process names to clipboard
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick actions with customizable shortcuts
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh the port list to see current system state
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly notifications

## Installation

1. Install [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) on your Windows system
2. Open Raycast and search for "Port Manager"
3. Install the extension from the Raycast Store
4. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

## Usage

### Opening Port Manager
- Open Raycast (`Win + Space` by default)
- Type "Manage Open Ports" or "ports"
- Press Enter to launch the extension

### Managing Ports
1. **View Ports**: All open TCP ports are displayed with their local addresses
2. **Identify Processes**: Each port shows the process name and PID using it
3. **Search**: Use the search bar to filter by port address, PID, or process name
4. **Kill Process**: Select a port and press `Ctrl+Shift+K` or use the "Kill Process" action
5. **Refresh**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` or use the "Refresh List" action to update the port list

### Available Actions

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Kill Process | `Ctrl+Shift+K` | Terminate the process using the selected port |
| Refresh List | `Ctrl+Shift+L` | Update the port list with current system state |
| Copy Process Name | - | Copy the process name to clipboard |
| Copy Address | - | Copy the port address to clipboard |
| Copy PID | - | Copy the process ID to clipboard |

## Technical Details

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Raycast application
- Administrator privileges (for process termination)

### How It Works
The extension uses Windows system commands to gather port information:
- `netstat -ano -p tcp`: Lists all TCP connections and their associated PIDs
- `tasklist /fo csv`: Retrieves process names for the identified PIDs
- `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`: Terminates processes by their PID

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React-based UI using Raycast's API
- **Port Detection**: Native Windows commands via Node.js child_process
- **Process Management**: Direct system command execution for process termination
- **State Management**: React hooks for real-time UI updates

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Raycast CLI

### Setup
